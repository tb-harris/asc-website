# All Star Code Web Development Assessment

Single-page website for the ASC web development assessment. Plain HTML, CSS, JS with no external libraries.

Everything is my own work except reset.css and bone.css (bone shape).

Notable features:
* responsive design using flexbox and media queries
* CSS animations on page load
* JS slideshow with CSS transitions
* interactive component (bottom right) made with CSS transitions
